Receiving DLR
#############

When requested through dlr-* fields when :ref:`sending_sms-mt`, a delivery receipt (**DLR**) will be sent back to the 
application url (set in **dlr-url**) through **HTTP GET/POST** depending on **dlr-method**. 

The receiving end point must reply back using a "**200 OK**" status header **and** a body containing an **acknowledgement** of 
receiving the DLR, if one or both of these conditions are not met, the *DLRThrower service* will consider reshipment of the same 
message if **config/dlr-thrower/max_retries** is not reached (see :ref:`configuration_dlr-thrower`).

In order to acknowledge DLR receipt, the receiving end point must reply back with **exactly** the following html body content::

   ACK/Jasmin

.. note:: It is very important to acknowledge back each received DLR, this will prevent to receive the same message many times, c.f. :ref:`DLRThrower_process` for details
.. note:: Reshipment of a message will be delayed for **config/dlr-thrower/retry_delay** seconds (see :ref:`configuration_dlr-thrower`).

HTTP Parameters for a level 1 DLR
=================================
The following parameters are sent to the receiving end point (at dlr-url) when the DLR's dlr-level is set to 1 (SMS-C level only)
